<h3> Hello, my name is Garret Ogden and I am 28 years old. As I mentioned before, I am a CIT student at IUPUI, and I am currently a senior. </h3> 
<h3>My current concentration is in Web Dev, and I hope to get a job in the Software industry.</h3>
<h3>So far, prior to Covid, one of my favorite memeories of attending IUPUI haa been the unique experience that I've had, meeting all new people, and being taught by such fun teachers who enjoy their work as much as they do has been a real blast. </h3>
